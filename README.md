# Machine Learning Classification Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates a supervised machine learning classification approach using Python.

## Dataset
A publicly available dataset was used for educational and research purposes.

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature selection
- Model training using classification algorithms
- Model evaluation

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Results
The implemented models were evaluated using accuracy-based metrics. Performance improved after preprocessing and basic parameter tuning. This project strengthened my understanding of machine learning workflows and evaluation techniques.
